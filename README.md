mojito-pipeline
===============
Mojito-pipeline allows a mojito app to selectively schedule the rendering, the streaming, and the displaying of mojits (sections) of the page from the server to, and on, the client (browser). It leverages Node's event-oriented architecture to let you push those sections as their data comes from the backend; it handles structural dependencies, custom programmatic dependencies, errors and timeouts; and it gives you a lot of power to manage the lifecycle of your sections.
