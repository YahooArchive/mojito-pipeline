mojito-pipeline
===============
mojito-pipeline allows a mojito app to selectively schedule the rendering, the streaming and the displaying of mojits/sections of the page from the server to and on the client/browser. It leverages node's event-oriented architecture to let you push those sections as their data comes from the backend and handles structural dependencies, custom programmatic dependencies, errors and timeouts, and gives you a lot of power to manage the lifecycle of your sections.
